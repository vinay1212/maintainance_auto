# Maintenance_Automation
Currently in hostels, complaints are recorded in books. The complaints are filled but it is tough to find the pending complaints since it is written on different pages of a book. Also, different types of complaints are all registered in the same book. When a technician in a particular field goes through the book to fix the complaint it will be hard to keep track of which complaints come under his domain. Hence, categorization of complaints is not done while registering them on books.  The hostel authorities face issues regarding fixing of complaints in the hostel. The complaints are recorded in a notebook and it is difficult to keep track of which complaint is already fixed and which is not.  We are creating a website in such a way that there is a provision for the hostel complaints in the website. While registering a complaint you will have to choose the type of complaint. Any types of complaints are welcome

. The type of complaints include:-
1.)	Mess Complaints
2.)	Electrical Complaints
3.)	Architectural Complaints
4.)	Wi-Fi Complaints
5.)	Washroom Complaints
6.)	Hygiene Complaints
Also, while registering a complaint, the user will have to enter the following details for identification. This includes:-
1.)	Full Name
2.)	Registration Number
3.)	Gender
4.)	Block
5.)	Room number
6.)	Subject
7.)	Complaint
On filling up all this, your complaint form will be sent to the authorities and they can click on “Done” once the complaint is fixed.


Introduction
The main problem is improper and insufficient method to record the data of complaints in VIT hostels. Such inefficiency in maintaining proper record leads to complaints not been looked into and pending complaints remain or are overloaded.
The hostel authorities face numerous issues regarding fixing such complaints  and to keep in track of solved complaints.
We are creating a web based application to resolve this problem where this website will cater to all the needs that the manual complaint registering system fails to satisfy.The website is very compatible and user – friendly with an attractive user interface.

MODULE DESCRIPTION
We have used three different actors in this project , thereby three different modules.
•	ADMIN MODULE – The admin module is specifically for the admin whose task is to assign each complaint to an engineer.
•	ENGINEER MODULE – The engineer module is for those engineers or workers who fix the complaints assigned to them and provide a feedback for the same.
•	USER MODULE – The user module is for the hostel residents or even the staff who would want to complain.

CONCLUSION
This project can help save time in many aspects and will be of much use for students that need to fix problems at a faster rate. With our project, we aim at making a digital well-being and less time consuming way to register complaints in an organized and systematic manner in VIT’s database. Our project will be take our an idea evaluation for VIT’s software development circle.
